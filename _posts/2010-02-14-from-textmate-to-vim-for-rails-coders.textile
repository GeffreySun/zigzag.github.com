When started coding in Rails, I chose TextMate as my editor because it seems amazing as showed in the fantastic "RailsCasts from Ryan Bate":http://railscasts.com .  

Indeed the journey ramping up the learning curve of Rails with TextMate was very delightful. I continued using it in several projects and became familiar with it until one day I had to give off my beloved Mac Book and fall back to a Windows laptop. During the period waiting for my next Mac, I need to write Rails code without TextMate.

Developing Rails on Windows is a miserable experience for me. Therefore I rather chose to SSH my remote Linux box with PUTTY instead of using any windows GUI IDE. I used to write script in VI on Linux but for daily rails coding, VIM with some plugins would be better.

Days after I switched from TextMate, I found myself even more efficient and comfortable working with VIM, especially at the points I list below: 

h2. The mouse is not needed anymore.

For full keyboarder. Even the Columnar editing works better.

h2. I don't miss the Project Drawer 

Fuzzy finder and gf. window splitting. 

h2. I don't miss the File's Tab

h2. Project searching...

h2. Partial Extracting and Snippet.

h2. Conclusion
Work with out a GUI editor is a good news.
